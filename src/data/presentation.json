It is our current state of affairs that mainstream media would have us gloss over all the implicit and false assumptions, so that they can argue for any philosophy that will suit their ends. Our very questioning existence as man proves how essential it is to live an examined life. We question and can know with certainty that we are more than just a mind-body divide.\n\nThat's all the time we have for this week's episode! See you next time on Captain Philosophy."
